# Robot motion planning

### Ben Williams '25 - November 2023

The first part of this project was to plan the motion of an `n` jointed robot arm to avoid obstacles using a Probabilistic Roadmap (PRM). The second part of this project was to plan the motion of a Reeds-Sheep car around some obstacles to a goal location using a Rapidly Exploring Random Tree (RRT).

## PRM

The PRM and Workspace are in the main directory and are is all original code. You can test them by running the `prm_testing.py` file

## RRT

The planar motion files are most from Professor Balkcom (Dartmouth CS Professor), but `CarWorkspace.py`, `RRT.py`, and `rrt_testing.py` are all mine. Run `rrt_testing.py` to test the RRT implementation.
